## First Post

This is yet another attempt to create a personal website.
This time it's made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I write the posts locally using some text editor (currently I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)),
check if they are OK running `hugo server` and if so, I just commit the posts to a GitHub repository.

This triggers a [Git Hub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) pipeline which actually builds and deploys the website.
