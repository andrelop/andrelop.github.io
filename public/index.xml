      <description>Testing Hugo VSCode Plugins I&amp;rsquo;m testing VSCode plugins for Hugo, which is the static site generator solution I&amp;rsquo;m currently using.
At first, I have no interest in plugins to help with syntax highlight or code completion. The only thing I need is a set of shortcuts for running some Hugo commands, like starting and stopping the Hugo server, building the site, creating new posts, etc.
A plugin I found which does all of this is GoHugo.</description>

      <description>Personal Update What am I up to ? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m still working but these days I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly doing the same kind of work I used to do back in the day.
It took me many years to actually manage to distance myself from the most manual work. It&amp;rsquo;s still manual in the sense that my main work tool is a keyboard and I type at it the whole day, but I digress.</description>

      <description>First Post This is yet another attempt to create a personal website. This time it&amp;rsquo;s made using Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages.
I write the posts locally using some text editor (currently I use VS Code), check if they are OK running hugo server and if so, I just commit the posts to a GitHub repository.
This triggers a Git Hub Actions pipeline which actually builds and deploys the website.</description>
