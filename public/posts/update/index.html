<p>What am I up to ? Well, I&rsquo;m still working but these days I&rsquo;m not exactly
doing the same kind of work I used to do back in the day.</p>
<p>It took me many years to actually manage to distance myself from the most
<em>manual</em> work. It&rsquo;s still manual in the sense that my main work tool is a
keyboard and I type at it the whole day, but I digress.</p>
<p>I still work with infrastructure but it took me some time to understand that
infrastructure now is not really <em>metal</em> (you do not really rack servers
yourself in a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/data-center/">datacenter</a>).</p>
<p>I used to work on a company which had it&rsquo;s own datacenter so when people
said that you worked with infrastructure there it most likely meant that
you got your hands dirty and went to that cold place where a really large
amount of machines live in order to mess with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">servers</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_cables">cables</a> and stuff.</p>
<p>Today I work on an <em>infrastructure</em> team but there&rsquo;s no real physical
infrastructure to be managed at all. We are using 100% cloud infrastructure
and the team I&rsquo;m working on is one of the teams which <em>creates</em> infrastructure
on the cloud by writing a bunch of <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language">pseudo-code</a>.</p>
<p>We then use <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">a tool</a> which reads this pseudo-code
and talks to the cloud provider <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/">APIs</a> to
command it to actually spin up resources. These resources are things like
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-a-kubernetes-cluster">clusters</a>,
which are just a bunch of servers. <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-a-virtual-machine">Virtual servers</a>
as we are in a cloud context here.</p>
<p>We also happen to support some development teams by <em>debugging</em> what some
people also consider these days as <em>infrastructure code</em>, but which is not
exactly the same kind of infrastructure code our team writes.</p>
<p>This infrastrucuture code the development teams are writing are a bunch of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> which is used to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/declarative-config/">declaratively</a> create <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/"><em>deployments</em></a>
for the real application code they are also writing in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">more complete programming language</a>.</p>
<p>Our team deploys and maintains the infrastructure (<em>the cluster</em>) under which
the development team&rsquo;s deployments run.</p>
<p>We also happen to deploy and maintain <a href="https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">a solution</a>
for doing <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops">GitOps</a>, which
is a fancy term to say that when someone commits this bunch of YAML to a <a href="https://github.com/">source
code repository</a>, this YAML code automatically gets synced to a cluster and
then the application deployments are magically created inside this cluster.</p>
<p>Aditionally, when the development teams have trouble with their deployments
we help them by troubleshooting these deployments in order to find out where&rsquo;s
the issue. They mostly seem to think the issue is in our layer of the
infrastructure (<em>the cluster</em>).</p>
<p>Most of the time it turns out that the issue is not really in the cluster
but in the YAML files they are writing to do their deployments.</p>
<p>This is currently my day-to-day job. A mixture of multiple technologies which
no sane non-technicall people would like to talk about.</p>
